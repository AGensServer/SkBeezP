# SkBeezP

[ SkBeezP is a fork towards SkBee ]
Since SkBee was discontinued, i'm going to attempt to recreate it

[DISCLAIMER]:
This plugin will be buggy and not like SkBee, I'm not shanebee but i'm interested in
maintaining a NBT/Addon Solutions since many other servers use skbee and i use it too,
I'm hoping that this will become a success but only time will tell

[TODO]:
(This is from the readme.md on SkBee)
NBT elements: get/set NBT of items, block and entities.
ScoreBoards: anti-flicker scoreboards
Particles: A Particle system that is a little more advanced than Skript's, that is more inline with Bukkit's particle system (not sure how this would work)
TextComponets: a system a little more advanced than Skript's text formatting. You can build text components and manipulate each one separately with things like hover events (including showing an item), click events, and much more.
WorldCreator create your own custom worlds with some handly little options
